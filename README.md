#QuickTerms

## Description

The dreaded "I Accept" checkbox. You need to check it almost every time you register for a website or service. We live in the fast paced world of technology, and nobody wants to slow down to read something as long and boring as the Terms and Conditions. QuickTerms makes this an issue no longer! QuickTerms is a smart service that can read the Terms and Conditions for you, and then show you only the most important pieces.

A bit of history: In the past, a friend of mine and I wrote an AI that learned to identify cyber bullying on Facebook, but that took us a couple months to write and train the AI.  Here I worked with another friend of mine, Fox Wilson.  We wanted to write an AI to pick the key points out of Terms and Conditions, as they are normally too long to read by themselves. We had no idea how in the world we would get an AI that does that in just two days.  After debating over what the best way to approach this was, we thought of a way to get a fairly accurate AI done in such a short amount of time.  Trading of only a little accuracy, for a much shorter time need to train and write.

## APIs used

We did not use any of the APIs.  However, the program does use Google to find the Terms and Conditions of websites.
